React + Redux + Phoenix basic application

The application is almost the same simple one you get with fresh Phoenix app, however it contains all the basic stuff to start with for React. It can be used as a template app or just for learning purpose.

Tech. stack:

  * Phoenix
  * Webpack
  * React
  * Redux

Batteries included:

  * Server-side rendering
  * Bootstrap
  * LESS (to ease integration of Bootstrap 3)
  * [Redux Devtools for Chrome extension](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension)

To start your Phoenix app:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
